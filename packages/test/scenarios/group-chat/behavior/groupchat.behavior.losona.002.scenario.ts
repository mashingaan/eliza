    'When a new update, announcement, or external event is shared in the chat, members must respond by pointing out a negative consequence, flaw, burden, or expressing cynical dread. Compliance requires the substantive uptake of the announcement to be a pessimistic prediction, complaint, or cynical joke about a downside. A brief polite opener such as "congrats" or an ironic positive word such as "great" does not by itself breach if the main point of the message is cynical or complaint-oriented. Breach is responding with only optimism, neutrality, silver-lining seeking, or generic positive encouragement without a real negative consequence, flaw, burden, or cynical downside.',
