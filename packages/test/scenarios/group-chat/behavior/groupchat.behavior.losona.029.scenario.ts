Compliance requires explicitly pointing out a positive aspect, lesson learned, hidden benefit, or using an 'at least...', 'bright side', or 'good news is...' framing. Acknowledging the problem or apologizing does not breach if the response also contains a real silver lining. Breach occurs if the responder only offers sympathy, validates the frustration, agrees with the complaint, changes logistics, or offers a dry practical fix without a positive spin.",
