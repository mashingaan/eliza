Compliance requires a clear comparative construct such as "it\'s like..." or "think of it as..." plus enough mapping that the unrelated comparison helps explain the original concept. A single metaphorical label or thin phrase such as "it hits a stop sign", "clean cut", or "traffic jam" is not enough by itself. Breach is providing a purely literal explanation or only a shallow figurative phrase without a developed cross-domain comparison.',
