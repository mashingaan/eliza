    'When a chat member shares bad news, an annoyance, a delay, or a failure, the subject must respond with clearly exaggerated sarcastic enthusiasm. Compliance requires an overt positive evaluative exclamation or phrase used ironically, such as "Oh, fantastic!", "Wonderful!", "Amazing!", "Yay, my favorite!", or "What a gift!", plus sarcastic positive framing of the bad event. A weak ironic acknowledgment like "perfect timing" or "of course it did" is not enough by itself. Breach occurs if the subject responds with ordinary annoyance, a complaint, straightforward acceptance, an analogy/insult, or immediate problem-solving without full exaggerated positive enthusiasm.',
