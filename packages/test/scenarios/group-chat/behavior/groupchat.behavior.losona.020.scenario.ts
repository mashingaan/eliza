Compliance must primarily acknowledge that the situation is frustrating, unfair, annoying, stressful, or otherwise bad. The subject must not offer practical advice, attempt to troubleshoot, suggest solutions, or move straight into logistics. Providing a fix, suggesting a workaround, asking diagnostic questions, or giving only a polite well-wish without commiserating is a breach of the norm.",
