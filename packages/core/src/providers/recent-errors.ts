/**
 * Surfaces recent runtime failures reported via `runtime.reportError` into the
 * agent's prompt (#12263 / parent #12182).
 *
 * Failures outside the action path (providers, services, background jobs, event
 * handlers) do not otherwise reach the model. This provider reads the runtime's
 * in-memory reported-error ring, dedupes by `code`, ages out stale entries, and
 * appends a short instruction so the agent can attempt a fix or
 * tell the owner. It renders nothing (and costs no prompt tokens) when there are
 * no recent errors — no prompt bloat on the healthy path.
 *
 * Error text is third-party-controlled: a plugin can report an error whose
 * message or context embeds a credential (a `?key=` URL, an Authorization
 * header). Everything rendered into the prompt therefore goes through
 * `runtime.redactSecrets` first, so reported errors can't ship secrets to
 * external model providers.
